# Book of Recipes

##Overview
Book of Recipes lets users browse and search through recipes, mark their favorites, and add notes to individual recipe instructions. We used a node server and Angular to build our front end, and created a separate Rails API for our backend. Recipes were imported from the Yummly API through a form we created and stored in our database.

##Technologies Used
